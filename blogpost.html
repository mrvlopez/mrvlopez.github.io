  <h1>Blog Post for Activity 3 - Data-based Modifications of Formative Assessment</h1>
  <!--Summarize your strategy for using, changing, and modifying formative assessments -->
  <p>As a future Computer Science teacher I realize the importance of assessments  and how the data collected can be used to improve instruction and also improve future assessments. Typical daily instruction is not sufficient to verify whether the students are mastering the subject. Fortunately, there are a lot of options available for creating and delivering assessments and I intend to make use of several of them.</p>

  <p>I will create a schema for every assessment that I make. That blueprint will clearly state the name, goal, and delivery method for the assessment. To me the key part of the blueprint is the goal, as it will dictate what data is being collected. How I will evaluate that data will be the biggest challenge as it will play a key role into any changes or modifications that I make.</p>

  <h2>The Assessments</h2>
  <p>Because my field is computer programming I have the advantage that I can create assessments in ways that other teachers cannot. While I will rely heavily on traditional quizes of multiple choice, fill in the blanks, and true or false, those will be secondary to the more hands-on assessments I have in mind. These will be more project based, very small projects that can be done in a few hours and will clearly demonstrate the students mastery. I could provide a plain, unstyled HTML page to my students and have add the styling to test their CSS skills. I could also provide them with some JavaScript code that contains errors and have them point out and fix the errors. I believe these hands-on assessments combined with traditional assessments will give me a clear view of which students are mastering the subject.</p>

  <h2>The Data Collected</h2>
  <p>For traditional assessments I will rely mostly on Google Forms. They have developed a very efficient system of making assessments and having them graded automatically. The data collected can be sent to a spreadsheet where it can be easily sorted and visualized with charts. For hands-on assessments, which will consist of coding exercises, I will rely on the source code. Github Classroom will be my choice of code repositories for my students. They have a system where I can inspect all the code line by line and allows me to comment on the code in place, as I explain in the video.</p>

  <p>Once I collect the data for the more traditional assessments I will carefully examine and sort the data to get a clear picture of how the class as a whole is doing. I will also make charts of the data to get a more visual perspective on the data. Perhaps I could lump many assessments together in one worksheet to keep track of the historical trend for each individual student. That would give me a clear view if the student is improving or heading downwards. </p>

  <h2>The Modifications</h2>
<p>Once I analyze all the spreadsheet data and the source code for my coding projects I will have to make some tough decisions regarding how I am teaching the subject and whether the assessment itself should be changed. I will make changes if I notice my ELL and handicapped students are not performing well. I will re-evaluate my rubric to see if anything can be simplified or if it was not detailed enough. Perhaps it is possible that the assessment should be split into two. I am open to student input on how the assessment will be made as long as 100% of students are able to participate to include all ELL and handicapped students.</p>
