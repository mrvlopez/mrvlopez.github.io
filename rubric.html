  <h1>Activity 1 - Assessing Project Based Learning</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>As a future computer science teacher I look forward to having the opportunity of having my students make this project in real life. This is a group project where the teams aim to make a website for the school's computer lab. The winning team will have their website hosted by the school and will officially become part of the school's website. The project is the perfect opportunity for my students to practice their web development skills and also get real-life experience at web collaboration and team building. All projects will be hosted on Github.</p>
    <p>In order to handle the many hiccups that arise when building a large coding project I have incorporated weekly assessments or polls. The assessments will serve as a refresher for the animation and layout skills that the students will need to complete the project. The team leaders poll will inform me of which student is doing what and whether any of them is exhibiting a lack of participation. I will utilize Github commenting features to leave feedback right there where the code resides.
    I will hold weekly Zoom meetings with the team leaders to be updated on the status of their project and to address any issues. </p>
  <h3>Project Objective: Computer Lab Website</h3>
  <p>Groups of students compete to build the best website to showcase the school's
    new computer lab.
  </p>

  <h3>Learning Outcomes:</h3>
  <p>The project will serve as an opportunity for students to showcase their mastery
    of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. Building the website will give students ample
    opportunity to get hands-on training on their coding abilities. Students will learn 
    what it's like to work in a team and how important collaboration and communication are to the successful completion of the project.
  </p>

  <h3>Final Project Outcome</h3>
  <p>The winning group will have their website hosted by the school and will become a
    part of the official school website. The site will showcase the school's new computer
    lab, including all of its hardware, software, educational opportunities and an animated picture gallery. The website will be responsive, looking good on small devices and accesible to screen readers.

    <li>End of Week 2: Teacher + team leaders Zoom meeting. Google Forms Team Poll.</li><br>
    <li>Week 3: Github collaboration continuesm Google Forms JavaScript Assessment.</li>
    <li>End of Week 3: Teacher + team leaders Zoom meeting.</li><br>
    <li>Week 4: Final Zoom meeting with team leaders. Final changes commited to Github.</li>
    <li>End of Week 4: All websites deployed. Winner chosen. Individual team feedback provided.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Whether they won the competition or not, all students will have participated in a real-life collaborative project. They will be better prepared to work as a team, to meet deadlines, and rely on collaboration to complete their tasks. These type of collaborative coding projects will prepare students to create their own apps or join a major player in Silicon Valley. It is my hope that my students will fill the gap that sadly exists in Silicon Valley regarding women, latinos, and minorities.</p>
